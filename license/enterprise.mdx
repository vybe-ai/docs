## Why choose Nutshell AI as your enterprise solution?
Nutshell AI is built with data privacy at its core. Our app operates entirely on your deviceâ€”ensuring that no meeting data, whether it's recorded audio, transcriptions, or notes, ever leaves your laptop. We never process your information on external servers; all transcriptions and AI-driven chat functions run locally with our cutting-edge models.

For enhanced troubleshooting, we do send limited metrics and logs to our secure servers. However, this feature is completely optional and can be disabled in the app's settings.

At Nutshell, we understand that your meeting data is invaluable, and we're committed to keeping it private and secure every step of the way.
