## Volume Control Limitations

Due to macOS limitations with multi-output devices, changing the system volume while using <Tooltip tip="When you launch Nutshell, the application creates a virtual audio device called Nutshell Speaker. This device is essential for capturing your meeting audio and enabling real-time transcription.">Nutshell Speaker</Tooltip> may not work as expected. This is a known limitation of macOS that affects virtual audio devices.

## Using Nutshell's Built-in Volume Control

To address this limitation, we've implemented a dedicated volume control feature directly within the Nutshell desktop application.

<Steps>
  1. Open Nutshell application
  2. Locate the speaker dropdown menu in the top-right corner of the application, which contains volume controls
  3. Adjust the volume by dragging the slider left (decrease) or right (increase)
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

If you're experiencing issues with volume control:

1. Ensure "Nutshell Speaker" is selected as your output device
2. Deselect "Nutshell Speaker" in your system settings, choose your desired output device, and verify you can hear audio
3. Try restarting the application if volume control is unresponsive

<Warning>
  If you need to use system-wide volume control, you'll need to switch back to your default audio output device.
