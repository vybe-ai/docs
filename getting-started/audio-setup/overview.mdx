## Understanding Nutshell Speaker

When you launch Nutshell, the application creates a virtual audio device called "Nutshell Speaker". This device is essential for capturing your meeting audio and enabling real-time transcription.

<Note>
  You must select "Nutshell Speaker" as your output device to allow our application to transcribe your audio.
