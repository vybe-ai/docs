title: Setup for Zoom
---

The setup process for Zoom is the same as our standard setup process described in our [First Meeting Guide](https://help.withnutshell.com/getting-started/transcribe-your-first-meeting).

Simply follow those instructions while using Zoom for your meeting, and Nutshell will capture and transcribe the audio automatically.
