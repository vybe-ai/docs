## Audio permissions

When you first start a transcription session in Nutshell, a system dialog will appear requesting permission to access your microphone. You'll need to grant this permission for Nutshell to capture and transcribe audio from your meetings.

If you accidentally deny permission, you can grant it later in System Settings > Privacy & Security > Microphone.
