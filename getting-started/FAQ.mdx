## General Usage

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How specific do my chat prompts need to be?">
    You can start fairly general, and our AI will do its best! 
    However, the more specific you are with details like colors, objects, movement style, text, and desired mood, the closer the initial result will be to your vision. 
    Don't worry, you can always refine it through further chat.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I don't like the animation the AI generates?">
    That's perfectly normal, especially during the creative process! 
    Simply continue chatting with the AI. 
    Tell it what you'd like to change â€“ for example, "Make the background blue," "Make the text move faster," or "Add a star icon." VYBE is designed for iterative refinement.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I edit the animations after they are generated? How?">
    Yes! Editing in VYBE is done through the same chat interface. 
    You don't use traditional editing tools. 
    Just describe the changes you want to make to the existing animation, and the AI will update it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I upload my own assets (logos, images, brand colors)?">
    Yes! You can upload your own assets to VYBE.
    Just use the "Attach" button in the chat interface to upload your assets.
    
    
    VYBE Pro subscribers can also access our brand kit feature, which allows you to seamlessly integrate your brand assets such as colors, logos, fonts, and more into your animations for consistent, professional results.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What controls do I have over things like colors, fonts, timing, or style?">
    You control these elements by describing them in your chat prompts. 
    For example: "Use a bright yellow background," "Make the font a modern sans-serif," "Animate the text to appear slowly over 3 seconds," or "Create a playful, bouncy animation style."
    
    
    Depending on the complexity of the animation, you may also be able to update things like colors, fonts, and text directly in the video preview by clicking 'Update Content'.
  </Accordion>

## Account & Subscription

  <Accordion title="How does VYBE's pricing work? / What are credits?">
    VYBE operates on a subscription model with different monthly credit plans. For example, you might choose a plan with 100, 200, or 300 credits per month. 
    Each credit allows you to submit one AI chat prompt to generate or iterate on an animation. 


    More info about subscriptions can be found [here](/subscription/purchase-subscription).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if I run out of credits during a month?">
    If you use all your credits before your monthly renewal, you'll have the option to upgrade to a higher tier plan to get more credits immediately. 
    Otherwise, your credits will refresh at the start of your next billing cycle.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I change or cancel my subscription plan?">
    Yes, you can change or cancel your subscription plan at any time. 
    You can do this on your account settings page on the [VYBE website](https://vybe.im/settings?tab=billing).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are my generated animations saved? Where can I find them?">
    Yes! All animations you generate are automatically saved to your personal VYBE user profile.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What if the AI isn't understanding my prompts correctly?">
    Try rephrasing your prompt, being more specific, or breaking down a complex request into smaller steps. 
    Sometimes, adding context or clarifying an ambiguous term can help. You can also try the 'Prompt Enhancement' feature on the chat box. 


    If the issue persists, please feel free to reach out to support@vybe.im. We're continuously looking improving our AI's understanding!
